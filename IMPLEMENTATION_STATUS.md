### ✅ Medium Priority Features

1. **Search & Filters**
   - Search players by name (`?search=` parameter)
   - Filter by team (`?team_id=` parameter)
   - Fast database queries with indexes

2. **Notes Templates (Feedback Templates)**
   - Save common feedback phrases
   - Reuse templates across evaluations
   - Track usage statistics
   - CRUD operations for templates

3. **Photo Upload**
   - Upload player photos
   - Base64 encoding for storage
   - Display in player profiles
   - `/api/players/{id}/photo` endpoint

## Backend API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register new coach
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login and get JWT token
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user info

### Teams
- `GET /api/teams` - List teams
- `POST /api/teams` - Create team

### Players
- `GET /api/players` - List players (with search & filter)
- `POST /api/players` - Create player
- `GET /api/players/{id}` - Get player with evaluations
- `PUT /api/players/{id}` - Update player
- `DELETE /api/players/{id}` - Delete player
- `POST /api/players/{id}/photo` - Upload photo
- `GET /api/players/{id}/pdf` - Download PDF report

### Evaluations
- `GET /api/evaluations` - List evaluations
- `POST /api/evaluations` - Create evaluation
- `POST /api/evaluations/bulk` - Bulk create evaluations

### Feedback Templates
- `GET /api/feedback-templates` - List templates
- `POST /api/feedback-templates` - Create template
- `DELETE /api/feedback-templates/{id}` - Delete template

## Pending Frontend Updates

The frontend needs to be updated to work with the new authenticated API:

### Required Changes

1. **Authentication UI**
   - Login/Register forms
   - Token storage (localStorage)
   - Protected routes
   - Logout functionality

2. **API Integration**
   - Update all API calls to include JWT token
   - Handle authentication errors
   - Update data models to match new schema (integer IDs instead of UUIDs)

3. **New Features UI**
   - Team management interface
   - Player photo upload
   - PDF download button
   - Search/filter controls
   - Feedback templates UI
   - Bulk evaluation mode

4. **Service Worker for PWA**
   - Background sync with authentication
   - Offline data storage
   - Cache management
   - "Add to Home Screen" support

### Comparison Charts

The backend stores all evaluation history, making it easy to create comparison charts showing:
- Skill progression over time (line charts)
- Before/after comparisons
- Multi-player comparisons
- Trend analysis

Frontend implementation would use Chart.js or Recharts to visualize the data from `/api/players/{id}` endpoint which includes full evaluation history.

## Database Schema

### Users
- id, email, username, hashed_password
- full_name, created_at, is_active

### Teams
- id, name, age_group, season
- coach_id (FK to users)

### Players
- id, name, jersey_number, position, age_group
- team_id (FK to teams), coach_id (FK to users)
- photo_url, created_at

### Evaluations
- id, player_id (FK), evaluator_id (FK)
- date, evaluation_type, evaluator_name
- skating, shooting, passing, puck_handling, hockey_iq, physicality (1-5 ratings)
- notes, strengths, areas_for_improvement

### FeedbackTemplates
- id, name, category, text
- coach_id (FK to users)
- created_at, times_used

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd hockey-eval-pwa/backend
poetry install
```

2. Create `.env` file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your DATABASE_URL and SECRET_KEY
```

3. Create database and run migrations:
```bash
createdb hockey_eval
poetry run alembic upgrade head
```

4. Start server:
```bash
poetry run fastapi dev app/main.py
```

### Frontend Setup (Current State)

The frontend still uses the old in-memory API. To use it with the new backend:

1. Update API base URL in frontend code
2. Add authentication flow
3. Update data models
4. Add new feature UIs

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Authentication** - Add login/register UI and token management
2. **Update API Calls** - Modify all API calls to use new endpoints with auth
3. **Service Worker** - Implement proper PWA with background sync
4. **Comparison Charts** - Add visualization components for progress tracking
5. **Testing** - Add comprehensive tests for backend and frontend
6. **Deployment** - Deploy to production with proper environment configuration

## Technical Decisions

- **PostgreSQL**: Chosen for reliability, ACID compliance, and wide support
- **JWT Authentication**: Industry standard, stateless, works well with PWA
- **SQLAlchemy**: Mature ORM with excellent PostgreSQL support
- **FastAPI**: Modern, fast, automatic API documentation
- **ReportLab**: Powerful PDF generation library
- **Alembic**: Standard migration tool for SQLAlchemy

## Security Features

- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (industry standard)
- JWT tokens with configurable expiration
- Data isolation per coach (can't access other coaches' data)
- SQL injection protection via ORM
- CORS configured (needs production settings)
