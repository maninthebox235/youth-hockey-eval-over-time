## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd hockey-eval-pwa/backend
poetry install
```

2. Create `.env` file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your DATABASE_URL and SECRET_KEY
```

3. Create database and run migrations:
```bash
createdb hockey_eval
poetry run alembic upgrade head
```

4. Start server:
```bash
poetry run fastapi dev app/main.py
```

### Frontend Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd hockey-eval-pwa/frontend
npm install
```

2. Create `.env` file:
```bash
# Create .env file with:
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

3. Start development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:5173

## Next Steps

1. **Additional Frontend Features** - Implement team management, photo upload, PDF download, search/filter, templates, bulk mode
2. **Testing** - Add comprehensive tests for backend and frontend
3. **Database Setup** - Install PostgreSQL and run migrations
4. **Deployment** - Deploy to production with proper environment configuration
5. **Mobile Optimization** - Test and optimize PWA on mobile devices
6. **Performance** - Add caching, lazy loading, and optimization

## Technical Decisions

- **PostgreSQL**: Chosen for reliability, ACID compliance, and wide support
- **JWT Authentication**: Industry standard, stateless, works well with PWA
- **SQLAlchemy**: Mature ORM with excellent PostgreSQL support
- **FastAPI**: Modern, fast, automatic API documentation
- **ReportLab**: Powerful PDF generation library
- **Alembic**: Standard migration tool for SQLAlchemy

## Security Features

- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (industry standard)
- JWT tokens with configurable expiration
- Data isolation per coach (can't access other coaches' data)
- SQL injection protection via ORM
- CORS configured (needs production settings)
